## 🎯 Core Expertise & Engineering Focus

My expertise centers on leading and implementing complex security solutions:

### Identity & Access Management (IAM/IGA/PAM)
* **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Architecting and managing high-risk environments using **BeyondTrust** solutions.
* **Identity Governance (IGA):** Implementing and optimizing enterprise IGA systems like **SailPoint** and **Microsoft Entra ID**.
* **Identity Providers (IdP):** Deep proficiency in **Okta** and **Keycloak** for SSO, federation, and centralized access control.

### DevSecOps & Application Security (AppSec)
* **Security Integration:** Embedding security early in the SDLC using **SAST/DAST** and **GitHub Advanced Security** in CI/CD pipelines.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating secure provisioning and hardening of cloud resources with **Terraform**, **Bash** and **PowerShell**.
* **Container Security:** Expertise in securing Kubernetes/EKS workloads using **Calico** (eBPF and Network Policy enforcement).

### AI/ML for Cyber Defense (Blue Team)
* **AI Security Engineering:** Currently focused on leveraging Generative AI concepts (**RAG, Fine-Tuning**) and **AI Vector Search** for threat intelligence and security anomaly detection.
* **Incident Response & Automation (SOAR):** Designing and implementing **SIEM/SOAR** solutions (**Sentinel, Wazuh, Shuffle**) to automate detection and response playbooks.
